# Customer Support Agent

A support agent for Summit Outdoor, a fictional outdoor gear store. Users ask about products, stock and store policies, and the agent answers with live product data through MCP tools. All data is read-only mock data.

Before deploying, show the user what this sample is: the description and the architecture diagram (`docs/architecture.svg`) from `README.md`.

Three components run in one project:

```
Customer Support Agent (Agent Management) ──▶ gateway (MCP proxy) ──▶ products-mcp (Integration) ──▶ products-api (Integration, project only)
```

## Deploy on WSO2 Cloud

Deploy all three into the project that the user selected, to the Development environment, in this order. Repository: `https://github.com/TestAgenticEngOrg/customer-support-agent-sample`, branch `main`.

1. **Products API.** In Integration, create an integration named `products-api`: type REST API, path `products-api`, WSO2 Integrator runtime. Build it and deploy it. Keep its endpoint project-only.
2. **Products MCP server.** Create an integration named `products-mcp`: type `mcp-server`, path `products-mcp`, WSO2 Integrator runtime, no environment variables. Build it after `products-api` is deployed, then connect it to the API before deploying it:
   - Connect its configurable `wso2.products_mcp.productsApiUrl` to the Products API's endpoint with `connect_integration` (target integration `products-api`, target endpoint as `list_integration_connections` lists it). The platform then fills in the API's address inside the project.
   - Only if `connect_integration` isn't available: deploy once, then set the same configurable for Development to the **internal** URL of the API's deployed endpoint with `set_configurables`, and deploy again.
   - Deploy it, then make its endpoint public with `set_endpoint_visibility`, so Agent Management adds it as an MCP proxy. Wait until that proxy is listed.
3. **Customer Support Agent.** In Agent Management, create a platform-hosted Python agent named `customer-support-agent`: app path `/agent`, Python 3.11, default chat interface.
   - Attach the MCP proxy from step 2, with the environment variable names `PRODUCTS_MCP_URL` for its URL and `MCP_API_KEY` for its key, so Agent Management injects both.
   - Attach an Anthropic LLM provider, with the environment variable names `LLM_PROVIDER_URL` and `LLM_PROVIDER_KEY`. If the organization has none, ask the user to add one first.
   - Deploy again so that the agent gets the provider and the MCP server.

When the agent is active, tell the user to open **Try It** in Agent Management and ask, for example, "Is the Trailblazer jacket in stock in size M?".

## Code

`products-api` and `products-mcp` are Ballerina 2201.13.1 (`bal build`, `bal run`). `agent` is Python 3.11 (`pip install -r requirements.txt`, `python main.py`). See `README.md` for local runs and every environment variable.
